# breast-cancer-classification
This repository contains a Python implementation of a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier for the breast cancer dataset using scikit-learn. The code trains and tests the KNN classifier for different values of 'k' and plots the validation accuracies to identify the optimal 'k' value.
