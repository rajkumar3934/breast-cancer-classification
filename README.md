# Breast Cancer Classifier using K-Nearest Neighbors

## Description

This repository contains a Python implementation of a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier for the breast cancer dataset. The code uses scikit-learn to load the dataset, split it into training and validation sets, and train and test the KNN classifier for different values of `k`. The repository also includes a `README.md` file with installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and license details.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using `git clone`.
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## Usage

Run the `breast_cancer_classifier.py` file to train and test the KNN classifier and generate the validation accuracy plot. You can modify the `test_size` and `random_state` parameters in the `train_test_split()` function to change the size of the validation set and the random seed for the data split.

```sh
python breast_cancer_classifier.py
